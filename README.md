# Renewable-energy-project-final
# EduNet Green Skills & AI (Sustainable Agriculture) - Renewable Energy Project

This project is part of the EduNet Green Skills & AI initiative.  
It uses renewable energy datasets from Kaggle to analyze, clean, and generate insights about global renewable energy adoption.

## ðŸš€ How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/<yourusername>/Renewable-energy-project-final.git
   cd Renewable-energy-project-final
   ```

2. Set up Kaggle API:
   - Create a Kaggle account and download `kaggle.json` from [Kaggle Account Settings](https://www.kaggle.com/account).
   - Place it in:  
     - Linux/Mac: `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json`  
     - Windows: `C:\Users\<username>\.kaggle\kaggle.json`

3. Download dataset:
   ```
   kaggle datasets
   I used sample dataset 
   ```

4. Run the notebook or script:
   ```
   jupyter notebook notebooks/renewable_energy.ipynb
   or
   python app.py
   ```

5. The cleaned dataset will be saved to:
   ```
   data/renewable_energy.csv
   ```

## Features
